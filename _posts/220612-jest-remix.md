> I learn this while working on the Remix example for [Jest Preview](https://www.jest-preview.com/), which is a stellar library that lets you see your app UI while testing. Check it out at the official website.

Having been working with React for a while, you have probably heard about or used **[Jest](https://jestjs.io/)** for your unit/integration testing needs. Its strong ecosystem is one of the reasons why Jest has become so prominent in the JavaScript/React world. For me, libraries like React Testing Library, MSW, and Jest Preview are what make writing Jest tests so much more fun.

If you are moving to¬†**[Remix](https://remix.run/)**, you might have noticed that their ‚Äúofficial‚Äù templates (Blues, Indie, and Grunge) all use Vitest as the default test framework. While Vitest is growing in popularity, maybe you just want to stick with Jest for the time being due to its familiarity. This guide will show you how to do just that.

<aside>
üÉè Please keep in mind that this guide assumes a Remix app created with `create-remix` with no testing framework installed.

## Install Jest

First, install `jest` itself. If you are using `jest` version 28 or later, you must install `jest-environment-jsdom` too (according to their [migration guide](https://jestjs.io/docs/upgrading-to-jest28#jsdom)).

```bash
npm i -D jest jest-environment-jsdom
```

Configure Jest‚Äôs desired behavior by creating `jest.config.js` at the root of your project (next to `package.json`). Below is an example config you can copy-paste. It handles Remix‚Äôs absolute imports for you too! ‚ú®

```jsx
// jest.config.js

module.exports = {
  collectCoverageFrom: [
    '**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
    '!**/*.d.ts',
    '!**/node_modules/**',
  ],
  moduleNameMapper: {
    // Handle absolute imports in Remix
    '~/(.*)': '<rootDir>/app/$1',
  },
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.js'],
  testPathIgnorePatterns: [
    '<rootDir>/node_modules/',
    '<rootDir>/.cache/',
    '<rootDir>/build/',
  ],
  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
  transform: {
    // Use babel-jest to transpile tests
    // https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#transform-objectstring-pathtotransformer--pathtotransformer-object
    '^.+\\.(js|jsx|ts|tsx)$': 'babel-jest',
  },
  transformIgnorePatterns: ['/node_modules/'],
};
```

Don‚Äôt forget to create `jest.setup.js` at your project root, in case you need to run some common code before each test file is run. If you come from Create React App, this file is similar to `setupTests.js`. Leave this file empty for now.

```jsx
// jest.setup.js
```

Next, for Jest to understand JSX, you need to install `babel-jest` and its related presets, and do some configuration inside `babel.config.js`. If this file doesn‚Äôt exist, again, create one at the root of your project.

```bash
npm i -D babel-jest @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react
```

```jsx
// babel.config.js

module.exports = {
  presets: [
    ['@babel/preset-env', { targets: { node: 'current' } }],
    ['@babel/preset-react', { runtime: 'automatic' }],
  ],
};
```

Finally, add the familiar `test` NPM script to your `package.json` so that each time you want to fire up Jest, simply run the command `npm run test`.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    // ...
    "test": "jest --watch"
  }
}
```

‚Ä¶And that‚Äôs it! üéâ¬†You have successfully set up Jest in your Remix app. Now you are free to install your favorite testing library and start testing with Jest right away. Mine is **[React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)**, and if you want further guidance to install that, keep reading!

## Install React Testing Library

As of the time of this post, `create-remix` initializes with React version 17, which is not the latest one (version 18). This is why we need to install React Testing Library version 12, because from version 13 onward, [support for React 17 or below is dropped](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library/releases/tag/v13.0.0).

With that in mind, install `@testing-library/react` version 12, and optionally `@testing-library/jest-dom` if you want some nice additional matchers (like `toBeInTheDocument()`).

```bash
npm i -D @testing-library/react@12 @testing-library/jest-dom
```

If you installed `@testing-library/jest-dom`, add this line to your `jest.setup.js` to use the new, shiny matchers.

```jsx
// jest.setup.js

import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
```

üéä¬†Done. You can verify that you have set up everything correctly by creating a test file at `app/__tests__/index.test.js` (or `.ts` if you use TypeScript) and seeing it passes.

```jsx
// app/__tests__/index.test.js

import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import Index from '../routes/index';

it('should show welcome message', () => {
  render(<Index />);

  expect(
    screen.getByRole('heading', { name: /welcome to remix/i }),
  ).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

It sure feels good to see the green.

## Conclusion

I hope you found this guide helpful. Besides the usual perks (and pains, haha), if done correctly, testing in React can be delightful. Happy coding, and remember to have good coverage for your code. If you have any questions, feel free to drop me a message on Twitter and I will be happy to get back to you. Cheers ü§ú¬†ü§õ
